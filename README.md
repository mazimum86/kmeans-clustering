# K-Means Clustering

This repository contains an implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm, a popular unsupervised learning technique used to partition data into clusters based on similarity.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this implementation consists of unlabeled data points that need to be grouped into clusters. The data can be in any format, such as CSV, and typically includes numerical features.

## Contents

- **kmeans_clustering.py**: The main script that implements the K-Means clustering algorithm, including data preprocessing, model training, and visualization of the clusters.
- **data.csv**: The dataset file used for clustering.
- **requirements.txt**: A list of Python dependencies required to run the code.
- **plots/**: A directory containing visualizations of the clustered data.

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows these steps:

1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded from `data.csv` and prepared for clustering.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocessing steps such as scaling the data and handling missing values are applied to ensure optimal clustering performance.
3. **Model Training**: The K-Means algorithm is applied to the preprocessed data. The number of clusters (K) is specified by the user or determined using techniques like the elbow method.
4. **Visualization**: The resulting clusters are visualized using 2D or 3D scatter plots, with each cluster represented by a different color.
5. **Evaluation**: Metrics such as the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) and silhouette score are provided to evaluate the quality of the clustering.

## Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mazimum86/kmeans-clustering.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
    ```bash
    cd kmeans-clustering
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the K-Means Clustering script:
    ```bash
    python kmeans_clustering.py
    ```

## Dependencies

The following Python packages are required to run the code:

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

These dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file and can be installed using `pip`.

## Results

The output includes:

- **Cluster Labels**: The cluster labels assigned to each data point.
- **Centroids**: The coordinates of the centroids of each cluster.
- **Cluster Visualization**: Scatter plots showing the clusters and their centroids.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Metrics like the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) and silhouette score to assess the quality of the clustering.
